# Android app

The Android app lives in `mobile/`: a [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) 8 shell around the web
app (ADR-0017 in the project notes). There is no second copy of the UI.

## How it works

- **No server chosen**: the WebView runs the web build bundled into the app, at
  `https://localhost`, with data on the phone only.
- **Connected**: `MainActivity` points Capacitor at the server (`server.url`, set at start from the
  saved address). The WebView then loads that server's own web build, so cookies, live updates and
  the service worker work as in a browser, and the app always matches its server's version.
  Capacitor injects its bridge into that origin only.
- **`PunchlistShell` plugin** (`ShellPlugin.java`, used through `web/src/adapters/capacitor-shell.ts`):
  `info`, `checkServer`, `connect`, `disconnect`. The web build a server ships can be older or
  newer than the shell, so methods are only ever added and `info().api` says which exist.
- **Provider sign-in**: the plugin catches the WebView's move to `/auth/oidc/<name>/login` and
  opens `/auth/app/handoff` in a Custom Tab instead, with a PKCE challenge. The server signs the
  tab in through the provider, asks the person to confirm, and sends the tab to
  `<package>://auth?code=...`. The app posts the code and its verifier to `/auth/app/redeem` in the
  WebView, which gets a copy of the tab's session. See `server/src/Punchlist.Server/Auth/AppSignIn.cs`.

## Building

You need JDK 21 and the Android SDK (platform 36, build tools 36). Point `ANDROID_HOME` at the SDK.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @punchlist/mobile apk
```

That builds the web app, copies it into the Android project (`cap sync`) and builds
`mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`. Install it with
`adb install -r <apk>`. Unit tests for the native code:

```bash
cd mobile/android && ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
```

CI builds the debug APK in the `android-apk` job (manual on main and merge requests).

## Trying it against a local server

From the emulator, the computer is `10.0.2.2`, so a server published on port 8080 is
`10.0.2.2:8080` on the connect page (it warns about plain HTTP). For provider sign-in, the
provider must be reachable at the same address from the server and from the emulator.

## Not done yet

Release signing, the app icon and splash, native notifications, a native storage adapter, an error
page when the server cannot be reached on a cold start, and linking a provider account from
Settings (that flow still runs inside the WebView).
